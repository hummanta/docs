# The Hummanta Documentation

Hummanta is a collection of modular, reusable compiler technologies and a comprehensive framework for rapidly building smart contracts. Designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, Hummanta empowers developers to create efficient, reliable, and secure smart contracts with ease.

The documentation is divided into two main sections:

- **Developers Section**: For developers looking to integrate with Hummanta or extend its features by leveraging our modular tools, APIs, and smart contract framework.

- **Users Section**: For users who want to learn how to utilize the Hummanta toolchain and framework to streamline their smart contract development workflows.
